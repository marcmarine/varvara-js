This repository contains a library of customizable and comprehensive UI components designed for smooth and simple browsing experiences.

## Motivation

Varvara decides to be consistent, but what does being consistent really mean? It's more than just an abstract concept: it involves maintaining a uniform line of conduct that conveys security and confidence. Being consistent is like being a person who always keeps their promises, a friend you can trust without hesitation, or a professional who predictably delivers quality results.

It's not about being rigid or inflexible, but about building a legacy for reliability. It's like a river that, although it can adapt to changes in the terrain, maintains its essence and direction. Consistency speaks of integrity, of aligning your actions with your values, and of generating a sense of stability that inspires confidence in others.

## Get started with Varvara CSS

The easiest way to use Varvara CSS is through a CDN:

```css
@import url('https://unpkg.com/varvara-css');
```

After, simply add a component class like this:

```html
<button class="va-button">Example button</button>
```
